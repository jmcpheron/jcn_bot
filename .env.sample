# The next part is where you could put a wallet's private key.
# But before you do, let's have a serious chat:
#
# 1. If you're thinking "what's the big deal?" - that's exactly why you should stop.
# 2. A private key here could control REAL money
# 3. One git push mistake = potentially emptied wallet
#
# Look, I want you to experiment and learn! But I also don't want you to lose money.
# So I'm deliberately naming this variable something slightly wrong to make this a little more difficult. 
#
# If you made it this far..... only add a few buck to this wallet okay?
